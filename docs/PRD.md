Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Petty Cash Expense Management Application ("PettyCashPlus")
Version: 1.5 (Final Draft)

1. Introduction
1.1. Problem
Managing petty cash expenses is a notoriously manual, slow, and inefficient process for both employees and the finance department. Employees face a cumbersome process of collecting, tracking, and submitting paper receipts, leading to delays, lost receipts, and frustration. For the business, this manual process is costly, prone to data entry errors, lacks real-time visibility into operational spending, and creates a significant administrative burden on line managers and finance teams, delaying reimbursement and financial closing.
1.2. Vision
To create a fully digital, intelligent, and seamless ecosystem for managing petty cash expenses. Our vision is a future where an employee can submit an expense claim from their mobile device, line managers can approve the expense, and the finance team can process the reimbursement with complete, accurate, and verified data, all within an inter-connected mobile and web based application. 
1.3. Mission
To empower employees and finance teams with a fast, accurate, and intelligent mobile-first solution for capturing, approving, and processing petty cash expenses, eliminating manual work and providing real-time financial insights.
2. Product Details
2.1. Target Audience
Primary Users (End Users): Any employee across the organization who incurs petty cash expenses. They need a quick and straightforward mobile-based way to submit petty cash claims, and want visibility into the status of their reimbursement, either through mobile or web application.
Secondary Users (Line Managers): Department heads or designated approvers responsible for validating their team's expenses. They need a simple, fast way to review and approve/reject claims, often on-the-go, both mobile and web application. 
Tertiary Users (Accounts & Finance Administrators): The finance team responsible for final verification, processing payments, and reporting. They require a comprehensive web-based view of all claims, robust administrative controls, and a reliable database of petty cash transactions suitable for export, transformation and loading into Accounting and ERP systems. The ETL will be managed by 3rd party automation software separate from this application. 
2.2. User Stories & Journeys
End User:
"As an employee, I want to log in using my account so that I don't have to remember another password."
"As an employee, I want to take a photo of my receipt and have the vendor, date, and amount automatically extracted to save time."
"As an employee, I want the app to suggest the correct expense category for me so I can file my claim faster."
"As an employee, I want to ask the app questions like 'what's the status of my claim from last week?' in plain language to get information quickly."
"As an employee, I want to see a dashboard with the status of all my submitted claims so that I know exactly where my money is."
Line Manager:
"As a line manager, I want to be alerted to claims that seem unusual or are outside of normal spending patterns so I can review them more carefully."
"As a line manager, I want to approve or reject claims with a single tap from my mobile device so I can process them quickly on the go."
"As a line manager, I want to filter claims by employee or status so I can prioritize my review."
"As a line manager, I want to add comments to a claim when I reject it so the employee understands why and can correct it."
Finance Administrator:
"As a finance admin, I want to perform bulk actions (e.g., approve, reject) on multiple selected claims at once so that I can process high volumes of standard expenses more efficiently."
"As a finance admin, I want an accurate database of petty cash transactions and their status available for ETL processing to 3rd party integrations such as ERP and Accounting software."
2.3. Core Features & Functionality

Multi-Currency Support: Automatically detect and convert foreign currency expenses.
3. AI & Google Cloud Integration
3.1. AI-Powered Features
The application leverages a multi-faceted AI strategy for a deeply intelligent experience:
Google Cloud Vision AI: When the user uploads a receipt image, the backend will call the Vision AI API's DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION feature. This service excels at extracting structured text (vendor, date, total) from receipts.
Gemini Models API:
Intelligent Categorization: Gemini will analyze the vendor name and text on the receipt (e.g., "Starbucks," "Latte") to intelligently suggest the correct expense category (e.g., "Meals").
Anomaly Detection: For each new claim, Gemini will compare the amount, vendor, and category against the user's past spending patterns and company averages to flag outliers.
Expense Assistant: This is the core conversational interface. When a user asks a question, the query is sent to Gemini. Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and function calling, Gemini will query the user's data in Firestore.
3.2. Google Cloud Architecture
Mobile & Web Frontend: Mobile app built using Flutter. The web app will be built with React and styled with Tailwind CSS.
Compute & Hosting: Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions for Firebase.
Database: Firestore.
AI & Machine Learning: Cloud Vision AI and Gemini Models API.
Authentication & User Management: Firebase Authentication.
Storage: Google Cloud Storage for receipt images.
Each registered Company  and associated users will have a dedicated independent database for their account to ensure confidentiality.
3.3. Justification
The applications architecture is entirely serverless, highly scalable, and cost-effective. The dual-AI approach uses the best tool for each job: Vision AI for structured data extraction and Gemini for nuanced understanding, reasoning, and conversation, delivering a superior user experience and stronger financial controls from day one.
4. Design & UX
4.1. High-Level UX Principles
Speed & Efficiency: The primary goal is to make the submission and approval processes as fast as humanly possible.
Clarity & Transparency: Users should always know the exact status of their claims.
Mobile-First: The end-user and line-manager experiences must be flawlessly designed for mobile devices. The same experience should be duplicated on the web app if they choose this platform to engage with the application. 
5. Non-Functional Requirements
5.1. Security
All data in transit and at rest must be encrypted.
Role-based access control (RBAC) must be strictly enforced.
PII must be handled in accordance with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
5.2. Scalability
The serverless architecture is designed to scale automatically to handle peak loads.
6. Mobile Platform & Distribution
Framework: The mobile application must be developed using Flutter.
Target Platforms: Google Play Store (Android) and Apple App Store (iOS).
Development & CI/CD Implications: The process must account for platform-specific configurations, code signing, and automated builds for testing and release.
7. Firestore Security Rules (Examples)
A user can only create/read their own claims.
A manager can read claims of their direct reports.
An admin can read any claim.
A user can only update their own claim if its status is 'rejected'.
An approver can only update a 'pending' claim if they are not the submitter.

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) will be maintained as a version-controlled Markdown file within a dedicated GitHub repository. This serves as the single source of truth for the product vision and requirements.
