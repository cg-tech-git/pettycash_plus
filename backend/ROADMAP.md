## Key Files to Create

1. `functions/src/index.ts` - Main entry point
2. `functions/src/auth/` - Authentication handlers
3. `functions/src/claims/` - Claim management
4. `functions/src/ai/` - AI service integrations
5. `functions/src/utils/` - Shared utilities
6. `functions/src/middleware/` - Auth & validation
7. `functions/src/models/` - TypeScript interfaces

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each service
- Integration tests with Firebase Emulator
- API documentation with Swagger
- Postman collection for manual testing
